## Email Body

```
Hi Shalini & Jatin,

We've been working on the landing page strategy this week, and something shifted.

The original plan was solid—data-driven, outcomes-focused, built on methodology and metrics. But it didn't feel *true* to who you actually are or what people actually need.

So we stepped back and asked a different question: **What does the world actually need from Kairos?**

And the answer isn't "better optimization" or "scientific proof."

It's **belonging**. **Recognition**. **Proof that you're not alone in this.**

So we've completely reframed the approach. Not to something less professional. To something more *true*.

Instead of:
- Leading with frameworks → Leading with recognition ("You feel empty despite success")
- Proving with statistics → Proving with real people's lives ("I couldn't sleep → I sleep again")
- Building authority through credentials → Building trust through vulnerability ("I walked this path, so I can guide it")

This is AA-model positioning. Community-first, not performance-first.

**I want to be completely honest**: This is a fundamental pivot. It might feel risky at first. But I think it's who you actually are.

## What We Need From You

1. **Read COMMUNITY_FIRST_REPOSITIONING.md** (attached or link below)
   - Take 20-30 minutes this week
   - It has everything: new landing page structure, website changes, assets needed, timeline

2. **Come to Monday 9 AM with thoughts on**:
   - Does this feel authentic to who you are?
   - Are you willing to be vulnerable in your personal origin stories?
   - Who are 3-4 clients you'd want to reach out to for deep story collection?
   - Any concerns or questions?

3. **Monday will be 60 minutes**:
   - I'll present the vision (20 min)
   - We'll discuss buy-in (15 min)
   - We'll lock immediate actions (15 min)
   - We'll confirm the 4-week timeline (10 min)

## The Timeline

- **Week 1**: You write personal origin stories + identify clients
- **Week 2**: Collect deep client stories + build landing page
- **Week 3**: Design + finalize website
- **Week 4**: Deploy both

Full details in the document.

## Why Monday?

Because we need to lock direction early. If this feels right, we execute with clarity. If it doesn't feel right, we iterate until it does. Either way, no confusion.

And then we have 4 weeks to build something real.

## The Ask

Read the doc. Come Monday ready to answer: **"Does this feel true?"**

Everything else flows from that.

## Document

## Next Steps

**After you read it:**
- Reply with any initial thoughts (no need to wait for Monday)
- Confirm you can make Monday 9 AM
- Let me know if you have questions

**Monday 9 AM:**
- Kickoff meeting
- Present the vision
- Get your buy-in
- Lock the work

**Then we execute.**

I think this direction is right. But I want to make sure you agree before we go all-in.

See you Monday.
