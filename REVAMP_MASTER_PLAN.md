# Kairos Landing Page Revamp — Consolidated Plan

**Audience**: Shalini and Jatin. Use this document to understand the full revamp strategy, decisions required, timeline, design system, technical specs, and QA process.

**What This Document Contains**: One master plan covering mission, messaging, 10-section architecture, website status, asset pipeline, decisions, design system, technical specs, CTA setup, QA process, timeline, and immediate tasks.

---

## 1. Mission & Current Context

**Goal**: Ship a community-first landing page and refactored website. The site must help burnt-out achievers feel seen, show proof through real lives, and convert visitors into discovery call bookings through low-friction conversations.

**Team Ownership**:
- **Shalini**: Guide story, client identification, community photos
- **Jatin**: Product strategy, copy, implementation, technical setup

Each task has one owner. There are no unassigned tasks.

**Current Website State**:
- ✅ Hero section rewritten (recognition-based)
- ✅ Methodology deep dive hidden (in HTML comments)
- ✅ Framework cards simplified (tag names only)
- ⏳ Coach bios, global copy polish, community/story assets, tooling decisions still needed

**Success Signal**: Qualified visitors book discovery calls because they feel recognized, safe, and curious. They don't book because we overwhelmed them with methodology.

## 2. Core Message & Tone (Use Everywhere)

Use these principles consistently across copy, email, social media, and the discovery call script.

**The Core Message**:
"External success doesn't guarantee internal peace. You're not broken, you're human, and you don't have to run alone."

**Tone Guidelines**:
- Write vulnerably. Share struggles, not just credentials.
- Write honestly. Use real stories, not generalizations.
- Prioritize community. "We're in this together" beats "Here's our methodology."
- Avoid jargon (no "psycho-spiritual," "evidence-informed," "integral frameworks").
- Avoid credentials-first introductions (lead with humanity, add credentials last).
- Avoid quick-fix promises ("12-week transformation," "optimize your life").
- Show proof through lives changed, not metrics (sleep returned, presence restored, purpose found).

**CTA Style**:
- Use conversational language: "Let's Talk About This," not "Schedule Consultation."
- Offer one primary action. Make it easy to click.
- Add an email fallback for hesitant visitors ("Or ask us anything" option).

## 3. Ten-Section Landing Page Architecture
| # | Section | Purpose | What Must Appear |
|---|---------|---------|------------------|
| 1 | Recognition (Hero) | Immediate resonance | Current hero copy + single CTA |
| 2 | You’re Not Alone | Belonging via real people | 3–4 named stories w/ photos |
| 3 | What Shifted | Proof through lived outcomes | Sleep, presence, clarity, purpose bullets |
| 4 | Community Gallery | Visual proof of belonging | 30–50 warm client photos |
| 5 | The Journey | Set honest expectations | Story copy about “real work in real time” |
| 6 | Who’s Guiding You | Trust via vulnerability | Shalini + Jatin origin stories + small credential footers |
| 7 | Three Phases | Simple structure | Discover → Integrate → Actualize cards |
| 8 | Community Again | Reinforce belonging | Larger grid or collage |
| 9 | One Deep Story | AA-style testimony | Full arc from one client interview |
|10 | The Invitation | Low-pressure CTA | Discovery-call invite + email option |

## 4. Website Implementation Status
- **Phase 1 (Hero)**: ✅ Live.
- **Phase 2 (Hide deep methodology)**: ✅ Content commented out; needs final destination (Section 6 below).
- **Phase 3 (Framework cards simplified)**: ✅ Only tags remain.
- **Phase 4 (Coach bios)**: ⏳ Pending origin stories + photos.
- **Phase 5 (Global brevity pass)**: ⏳ Week 2 polish—target sub-40-word paragraphs, plain language, intentional whitespace.
- **Testing**: Keep verifying on desktop + mobile + different ports (`localhost:8002` etc.) after each change.

## 5. Asset & Story Pipeline (Who Does What)

This section defines what assets you need to gather and who owns each deliverable.

| Deliverable | Owner | Timeline & Notes |
|-------------|-------|------------------|
| Personal origin story (2–3 paragraphs) + 2–3 warm photos | Shalini | Emphasize "breakdown → breakthrough." Put credentials at bottom only. Target: Wednesday of Week 1. |
| Personal origin story (2–3 paragraphs) + 2–3 warm photos | Jatin | Write in first person. Connect research background to human insight. Gather own photos. Target: Wednesday of Week 1. |
| Four deep client stories (Jacqui, Donald, Ajay, Antonia examples) | Shalini identifies + Jatin interviews/edits | Shalini: Identify 4 clients by Wednesday. Jatin: Run 45-min interviews Week 2, edit transcripts, secure approvals + photos. |
| Community gallery photos (30–50 minimum) | Shalini | Pull from existing archives. Confirm consent from all clients. Ensure diversity (age, gender, background). Target: Friday of Week 1 (at least 15). |
| Qualitative proof statements (if metrics unavailable) | Jatin | If hard numbers aren't verified, write qualitative statements instead. Example: "Most clients sleep through the night again within 2 months." |

## 6. Ops & Experience Decisions We Still Need
- **Primary CTA Path**: Decide Monday whether to stick with “Schedule Discovery Call” + Calendly (default) or reintroduce the assessment if it’s genuinely ready. Default to Calendly for MVP.
- **Pricing Transparency**: If exact tiers aren’t finalized, publish ranges (individual $4.5k–$6.5k, group $3k-ish) so visitors aren’t surprised. Otherwise, state “Discuss investment on the call.”
- **Methodology Deep Dive**: Choose one—(a) stand-alone `/methodology` page built Week 3, (b) gated PDF emailed post-opt-in, or (c) keep hidden indefinitely. Recommendation: new page so researchers have somewhere to land without cluttering hero.
- **Booking & Email Stack**: Stand up Calendly (or Cal.com) + GA4 tracking + email platform (ConvertKit/Mailchimp) during Week 2 so CTA flows don’t rely on manual follow-up.
- **Privacy/Terms**: Add links in footer before launch to close trust gap from earlier audit.

## 9. CTA & Conversion Setup

### Primary CTA: "Let's Talk About This"
- **Location**: Hero (Section 1), Final Invitation (Section 10), optional sticky header
- **Action**: Opens discovery call booking (via Calendly, Acuity, or HubSpot form)
- **Booking System Options** (choose one):
  - **Calendly** (recommended): Embeds directly, free tier, minimal setup
  - **Acuity Scheduling**: Branded, flexible, integrates CRM ($15+/mo)
  - **HubSpot Form**: CRM integration, email capture, two-step process
  - **External Page**: Link to separate booking domain

### Secondary CTA: Email Contact
- **Text**: "Or if you have questions first: Ask us anything"
- **Link**: mailto:contact@kairos.com
- **Auto-response**: Confirm receipt + next steps

### Analytics & Event Tracking (GA4)

Set up the following events in Google Analytics 4 to measure performance:

**Events to Track**:
1. `page_view` (auto-tracked)
2. `click_cta_primary` (when user clicks "Let's Talk About This")
3. `booking_initiated` (when user opens calendar widget)
4. `email_signup` (if form-based email capture used)
5. `click_email_link` (when user clicks email contact link)
6. `scroll_depth` (20%, 50%, 75%, 100% milestones = engagement signal)
7. `click_outbound` (clicks to external links, if any)

**Conversion Goals** (in order of priority):
1. **Primary**: `booking_initiated` (user opened calendar booking)
2. **Secondary**: `email_signup` (user provided email, interested but not ready)
3. **Tertiary**: 50%+ scroll depth (high engagement, likely to convert later)

**Weekly Dashboard Metrics** (monitor these every Monday):
- Unique users (who visited)
- Session duration (target: >2 min, means they read content)
- Bounce rate (target: <40%, lower is better)
- CTA click-through rate (target: >5%, higher means page resonates)
- Conversion rate (target: >2%, visitors booking calls)

### Email Integration

Many visitors will be interested but not ready to book immediately. Email nurtures these prospects.

- **Choose One Platform**: Mailchimp (free, simple), ConvertKit (creator-focused), HubSpot (CRM), or custom (Firebase)
- **Email Sequence**: 4 emails over pre/post-launch period (see LANDING_PAGE_FINAL_COPY.md for exact copy templates)
- **Goal**: Convert interested-but-hesitant visitors into eventual booking
- **Success Metric**: Click-to-book conversion rate >10% from email (not all will book)

## 12. Immediate To-Do List (No Empty Slots)

Every task below has one owner and a specific due date. Complete these before Week 1 Friday EOW to unblock Week 2.

| Task | Owner | Due | Details |
|------|-------|-----|---------|
| Send kickoff email + calendar invites to team | Jatin | Today | Email should reference this REVAMP_MASTER_PLAN.md doc (attachment or link). Include Monday 9 AM kickoff invite + Tue-Fri standup invites. |
| Prepare Monday kickoff walkthrough | Jatin | Before Monday | Prepare brief slides or doc covering: 10-section architecture, current status (PHASES 1-3 live), decisions needed (CTA, pricing, methodology). |
| Draft personal origin story outline + photo shortlist | Shalini | Tuesday | Write 2–3 paragraph outline emphasizing "breakdown → breakthrough." Shortlist 3 candidate photos (warm, genuine, approachable). |
| Draft personal origin story + photo shortlist | Jatin | Tuesday | Write 2–3 paragraphs in first person, connecting research background to human insight. Gather own 2–3 candidate photos. |
| Identify 4 client candidates + note transformations | Shalini | Wednesday | List client names, contact info, key transformation (sleep returned? relationships healed? clarity found?). Why does each fit Kairos positioning? |
| Build client outreach emails + schedule interviews | Jatin | Thursday | Customize outreach email (see examples in LANDING_PAGE_FINAL_COPY.md). Offer 45-minute slots for Week 2 (Tue-Thu). |
| Confirm 3 strategic decisions | Shalini + Jatin | Thursday | Lock in writing: (1) CTA system (Calendly vs. Acuity vs. HubSpot), (2) pricing transparency (ranges vs. "discuss on call"), (3) methodology destination (/methodology page vs. PDF vs. keep hidden). |
| Gather community gallery photos (first batch) | Shalini | Friday | Pull at least 15–20 approved photos from existing archives (ensure consent + diversity). Target: 50 total by Week 2 Friday. |

**Success Metric for Week 1 Friday**: All tasks complete. Move directly into Week 2 story capture without waiting for additional stakeholders or approvals.

## 13. Site Quality & Accessibility Fixes (Based on Nov 12 UX Audit)
| Priority | Issue | Required Fix | Owner |
|----------|-------|--------------|-------|
| **Critical** | Forms use placeholder Formspree ID (`YOUR_FORM_ID`) | Hook newsletter + contact forms to working Formspree (or Netlify/serverless) endpoints, add inline success/error feedback, keep aria-labels intact. | Jatin |
| **High** | Navigation + hero not mobile-friendly | Add hamburger/drawer below 768px, enlarge nav font/tap targets, reduce hero text clamp + add manual line breaks for readability. | Jatin |
| **High** | Content hierarchy weak (dense paragraphs, low-contrast CTAs) | Break story sections into shorter paragraphs/bullets, add subheads, increase CTA contrast (e.g., use accent gradient) and spacing. | Jatin |
| **High** | Nav visibility/active state subtle | Boost font size to base+, add bold active background/underline with sufficient contrast, ensure min 44×44px tap area and visible focus states. | Jatin |
| **Medium** | Placeholder assets (“Professional headshot coming soon”, “YouTube embed coming soon”) | Replace with real content as soon as assets arrive; otherwise remove blocks or use neutral graphic. | Shalini (photos) + Jatin (implement) |
| **Medium** | Contrast, alt text, semantic gaps | Run contrast checks on gradients, add overlays as needed, ensure all `<img>` tags include descriptive `alt`, add sr-only text for background images. | Jatin |
| **Medium** | White-space + paragraph spacing inconsistent | Apply spacing utilities (`--space-6` etc.), limit text width, increase line-height in long-form sections. | Jatin |
| **Low** | Button feedback + alignment | Strengthen hover/focus states using `--gradient-primary-hover` / outlines, tidy spacing in cards/footer, standardize external link styling with icon + label. | Jatin |

Tackle Critical/High items in parallel with content work so functional issues don't block launch readiness. Form integration + responsive nav should be completed before Week 2 design polish begins. Buttons, contrast, and spacing tweaks can fold into the Week 2/3 global copy tidy-up once the major assets are in place.
