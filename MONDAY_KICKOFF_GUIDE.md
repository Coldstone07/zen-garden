- Challenge: Starting from scratch on all assets
- Opportunity: You + Shalini + Jatin have everything needed to succeed

### PART 2: 3 CRITICAL DECISIONS (30 min)

**TIME**: 30 minutes (10 min per decision)

#### DECISION 1: Assessment Tool vs. Schedule Call (10 min)
**You lead**:
1. **Present the options** (2 min):
   - Option A: Assessment tool CTA (if live & delivering value)
   - Option B: Schedule Discovery Call CTA (simpler, lower friction)
   - Review: WEEK_1_KICKOFF_DECISIONS.md, Decision #1

2. **Ask the room** (2 min):
   - "Is the assessment tool ready?"
   - "Does it deliver immediate value (not just a type/score)?"
   - If unsure: Default to Option B for MVP launch

3. **Decide** (1 min):
   - [ ] Option A: Assessment CTA
   - [ ] Option B: Schedule Call CTA
   - Write decision on whiteboard/doc

4. **Document** (1 min):
   - "If assessment, what's the timeline?"
   - "Who owns the results page → booking link conversion?"

#### DECISION 2: Pricing Tiers (10 min)
**You lead**:
1. **Present the options** (2 min):
   - Option A: Exact pricing (e.g., $5–$6.5k individual)
   - Option B: Ranges (e.g., $4.5–$6.5k individual)
   - Option C: Defer pricing (discuss in discovery call)
   - Review: WEEK_1_KICKOFF_DECISIONS.md, Decision #2

2. **Ask leadership** (3 min):
   - "What are the exact tiers: individual, group, corporate?"
   - "What's the investment for each?"
   - "What's included in each tier?"
   - "Payment options: upfront, 2-pay, 3-pay, monthly?"

3. **Decide** (2 min):
   - [ ] Exact pricing locked + document
   - [ ] OR use ranges as fallback
   - [ ] OR defer to discovery call

4. **Document** (1 min):
   - Write exact prices (or ranges) on whiteboard/doc

---

#### DECISION 3: Secondary Page Strategy (10 min)
**You lead**:
1. **Present the options** (2 min):
   - Option A: Build separate /methodology-deep-dive page (best UX, more work)
   - Option B: Use anchor links on main page (simpler, faster)
   - Option C: Email PDF fallback (easiest)
   - Review: WEEK_1_KICKOFF_DECISIONS.md, Decision #3

2. **Ask the room** (3 min):
   - "Will /methodology-deep-dive page be built?"
   - "If yes: timeline? Who owns it?"
   - "If no: okay to use anchor links instead?"

3. **Decide** (2 min):
   - [ ] Option A: Build separate page (assign owner + deadline)
   - [ ] Option B: Use anchor links (simpler MVP)
   - [ ] Option C: Email PDF fallback

4. **Document** (1 min):
   - Write decision + owner + timeline

- "If we can't finish something by Friday, we have a documented fallback strategy. The launch timeline doesn't slip."

**For team blockers**:
- "Let's identify what's blocking you and unblock immediately. What do you need from me?"
