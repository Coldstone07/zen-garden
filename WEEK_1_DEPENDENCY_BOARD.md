## BOARD ITEMS (Copy each as a card into your Notion board)

### 1. Assessment Tool Decision
**Owner**: [Product Lead / Leadership]
**Due**: Monday EOD
**Risk Level**: 🔴 HIGH
**Decision Needed**: Assessment tool live & delivering value? YES or NO?
**If YES**:
  - Ensure results page → booking link conversion
  - Schedule testing Week 2
**If NO**:
  - Use "Schedule Discovery Call" as primary CTA
  - Build assessment as Phase 2 post-launch feature
**Fallback Copy**: "Let's talk about your transformation" (lower pressure)
**Blocker?**: [Describe if decision is delayed]
**Mitigation**: Default to "Schedule Call" CTA if assessment not ready

---

### 2. Pricing Finalization
**Owner**: [Leadership]
**Due**: Monday EOD
**Risk Level**: 🔴 HIGH
**Decision Needed**: Lock all pricing tiers (individual, group, corporate)
**Required Output**:
  - Individual: $X per 12 weeks (what's included?)
  - Group: $X per person (how many people? same content?)
  - Corporate: $X or custom formula?
  - Payment terms: Upfront, 2-pay, 3-pay, monthly?
**Required for**: FAQ section + landing page + sales conversations
**Fallback Strategy**:
  - Use ranges if exact not decided: "$4,500–$6,500"
  - OR defer pricing section: "Custom. Discuss in discovery call."
**Blocker?**: [Describe if decision is delayed]

### 3. Coach Metrics Verification
**Owner**: [Shalini + Jatin]
**Due**: Tuesday EOD
**Risk Level**: 🔴 HIGH
**Required Data** (from CRM):
  - **Shalini metrics**:
    - Total clients coached (claim: 200+)
    - % reporting improved well-being (claim: 98%)
    - Avg weeks to results (claim: 8 weeks)
  - **Jatin metrics**:
    - Total clients (especially tech professionals)
    - % maintaining gains at 6 months (claim: 95%)
**Method**:
  - Query CRM: Completed programs, assessment scores before/after
  - Document source (so we can defend claims if asked)
  - Export data to shared doc (Google Sheet/CSV)
**Output Format**:
  ```
  Metric: "200+ clients coached"
  Data: 187 completed programs + 25 in-progress = 212 total
  Source: HubSpot CRM, "Programs" table, filtered by status=completed
  Verified by: [Name + Date]
  ```
**Fallback Strategy**:
  - If exact # unavailable: Use qualitative ("Consistently guide clients...")
  - If data exists but can't be verified: Use ranges ("150–200+ clients")
  - If worried about legal liability: Say "Many clients report..." instead of specific %
**Blocker?**: [CRM doesn't have data? System access issues?]

  2. **Outreach email** (Tue): Personal invite, highlight their specific transformation
  3. **Incentive**: $25–50 gift card or free month of future program
  4. **Collection method**: Loom video (30–60 sec) or written quote + headshot

**Template Outreach Email**:
  ```
  Subject: Would you share your story? (Kairos gift card inside)

  Hi [Name],

  You went from [before state: 8/10 burnout] to [after state: 2/10, sleeping through night, etc.].
  That transformation is exactly what we want to share on our new landing page.

  Would you spend 2 minutes recording a short video or writing a quote about your experience?

  If yes: We'll send you a $50 gift card + share your story with people who need to hear it.

  [Loom link for easy video recording]
  or
  [Reply with quote + we'll use your photo]

  Thanks,
  [Shalini/Jatin]
  ```
**Example Testimonials Needed**:
  - 1 Tech professional (burnout → clarity)
  - 1 Mental health focused (anxiety/trauma → safety)
  - 1 Digital wellness (social media → real presence)
**Fallback Strategy**:
  - If <3 video testimonials: Use headshot + quote format
  - If <3 testimonials total: Use anonymized case studies with verified results
  - If NO testimonials collected: Delay launch 1 week OR use placeholder "Client Stories Coming Soon"
**Blocker?**: [Clients not responding? Metrics unavailable?]

---

### 7. Secondary Page Ownership (/methodology-deep-dive)
**Owner**: [Content Lead]
**Due**: Wednesday EOD
**Risk Level**: 🟡 MEDIUM
**Decision Needed**: Will secondary page be built? By when?
**Page Content**: Existing ~4,000-word Methodology Deep Dive (lines 3704-4382 of current index.html)
**Requirements** (if building):

**Blocker?**: [No owner assigned? Timeline unclear?]

---

### 8. Navigation Architecture Decision
**Owner**: [Dev Lead]
**Due**: Thursday EOD
**Risk Level**: 🟡 MEDIUM
**Decision Needed**: How will navigation work?
**Option A: Single-Page with Anchor Links (RECOMMENDED FOR MVP)**
  - Header nav: "Home | Methodology | Programs | Contact"
  - All links are anchor jumps: `#methodology-deep-dive`, `#programs-pricing`
  - Pros: Fast, simple, good for SEO
  - Cons: Single HTML gets long
  - Timeline: Can launch immediately
**Option B: Multi-Page with Separate URLs**
  - Header nav links to separate pages: `/`, `/methodology/`, `/programs/`, `/contact/`
  - Pros: Cleaner code, each page optimized separately
  - Cons: More complex, requires cross-page linking
  - Timeline: More dev work, delays launch
**Option C: Hybrid**
  - Main page (Home, Why, Guides, Outcomes) uses anchor links
  - Secondary pages (/methodology, /programs) separate URLs
  - "Learn More" dropdown with links
**Recommendation**: Option A for launch (keeps scope tight)
**What to Document**:
  - [ ] Which option chosen?
  - [ ] All nav items confirmed working (no dead links)
  - [ ] Mobile nav responsive (hamburger menu at breakpoint)
**Fallback**: Default to Option A if unclear
**Blocker?**: [Decision delayed?]

### 9. Booking Calendar Tool Selection & Setup
**Owner**: [Ops Lead]
**Due**: Thursday EOD (setup started), Friday (basics working)

  - [ ] Complete 3 test bookings
  - [ ] Verify confirmation emails sent
  - [ ] Verify CRM lead created

**Fallback Strategy**: If calendar tool not integrated by launch, use email form:

  - Collects: Name, Email, Preferred Times
  - Routes to coaches' email; they add to calendar manually
  - Higher friction, but functional
**Blocker?**: [Tool selection delayed? Integration issues?]
