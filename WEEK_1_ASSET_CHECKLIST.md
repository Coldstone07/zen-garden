# Week 1 Asset Checklist for Shalini & Jatin

## OVERVIEW
We're launching a new landing page in 4 weeks. This Week 1 checklist shows exactly what we need from you to make it happen. All items are needed by **Friday EOD** (or have fallback plans if delayed).

---

## SHALINI'S DELIVERABLES (Due Wednesday, with metrics by Tuesday)

### 1. Coach Bios & Photos
**Timeline**: Due Wednesday EOD

**What we need**:
- [ ] **2–3 professional headshots**
  - High resolution (min 500x500px, ideally 1200x1200px)
  - Format: JPG or PNG
  - Expression: Warm, confident, professional (friendly is better than stern)
  - Examples: LinkedIn profile pics (high quality version) or recent professional photo

- [ ] **Written bio** (to be reviewed together)
  - Current: From coaching_plan.md—you're "MIT & HBS graduate, Enneagram Guide, Trauma-Informed Coach, Somatic Healer, 30 years tech leadership"
  - What we need: Confirm if all of this is accurate + get your personal story (2–3 sentences)
  - Personal story should answer: "I spent [years] doing [X], but [transformation moment]. Now I help leaders..."
  - Example: "I spent 15 years climbing the ladder at Google, optimizing everything externally. But internally, I was falling apart. A personal breakthrough showed me that true transformation happens when we integrate our inner and outer worlds. Now I help leaders like you make that journey—without waiting as long as I did."

- [ ] **Verified credentials** (for credibility + legal accuracy)
  - MIT degree (confirm: name, year, field)
  - HBS degree (confirm: name, year, field)
  - Companies worked at (Ford, Sun, Oracle, Motorola, Google)
  - Certifications/training:
    - Enneagram guide (trained by whom? when?)
    - Trauma-informed coach (trained by whom? certification?)
    - Somatic healer (trained by whom? certification?)
  - Any awards/recognition (Crain's 50 Technology Talent?)
  - Speaker/educator (any notable speaking engagements?)

### 2. Client Outcomes & Metrics (For Credibility Claims)
**Timeline**: Due Tuesday EOD (so we can verify by Wednesday)

**What we're claiming on the landing page**:
```
"200+ clients transformed | 98% report improved well-being within 8 weeks"
```

**What we need from you**:
- [ ] **Total clients coached**: How many clients have you worked with? (claim: 200+)
  - Source: HubSpot CRM, coaching logs, or manual count
  - Include: COMPLETED programs + currently IN-PROGRESS
  - Please provide: [Exact number] or [range]

- [ ] **Well-being improvement**: What % of clients report improved well-being?
  - Method: Post-program survey, assessment scores (before/after), or client feedback
  - We're claiming: 98%
  - Please provide: [Exact % verified from data] or [range if exact not available] or [qualitative: "vast majority"]

- [ ] **Timeline to results**: How long until clients see results?
  - We're claiming: "Within 8 weeks"
  - Please provide: [Average weeks from start to noticeable improvement] from client feedback

**Export as**: Google Sheet or CSV with columns:
| Client Name (can be anon) | Start Date | End Date | Pre-Assessment Score | Post-Assessment Score | % Improvement | Key Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**If data not available**:
- No problem! We can use softer language instead:
  - "200+ clients coached" → "Many leaders coached" or "150–200+ clients"
  - "98% report improved well-being" → "9 in 10 clients report improved well-being"
  - "Within 8 weeks" → "Most clients see meaningful progress within 8–12 weeks"

### 3. Testimonial Outreach Help
**Timeline**: You help identify 6 candidates (Tue), then we send outreach (Tue/Wed)

**What we need**:
- [ ] **Identify 6–10 recent clients** (last 12 months) who:
  - Completed the program (or nearly completed)
  - Had good engagement + reported positive outcomes
  - Would likely be willing to share their story
  - Represent different personas if possible (tech professional, mental health focus, digital wellness seeker)

- [ ] **Provide us with**:
  - Client name (or first name + last initial if prefer anonymity initially)
  - Email address (for outreach)
  - Brief note on their transformation (e.g., "Went from 8/10 burnout to 2/10 in 12 weeks, sleeping through night again")
  - Contact preference (email, phone, Zoom call)

- [ ] **Be ready to personalize outreach** (optional):
  - We'll draft the outreach email, but if you could add 1-2 personal touches, it'll increase response rate
  - Example: "Hi [Name], I was thinking about your journey from [before state] to [after state]. That's exactly the transformation I want to share..."

## JATIN'S DELIVERABLES (Due Wednesday, with metrics by Tuesday)

### 1. Coach Bios & Photos
**Timeline**: Due Wednesday EOD

**What we need**:
- [ ] **2–3 professional headshots**
  - Same specs as Shalini (high quality, 500x500px minimum, JPG/PNG, warm expression)

  - Current: From coaching_plan.md—you're "AI Researcher, Community Builder, Cognitive Science background, Google Research & DeepMind"
  - What we need: Confirm accuracy + personal story (2–3 sentences)
  - Personal story should answer: "I spent [years] researching [X], but realized [insight]. Now I help clients..."
  - Example: "I spent years studying human behavior at the intersection of AI and consciousness. Then I realized the real transformation happens in lived experience, not the lab. My research in how people change informed this method. Now I help clients decode the patterns keeping them stuck and build the neurological foundations for lasting change."

- [ ] **Verified credentials**:

### 2. Client Outcomes & Metrics (For Credibility Claims)
**Timeline**: Due Tuesday EOD

**What we're claiming on the landing page**:
```
"Specialized in tech professional burnout recovery | 95% of clients maintain gains at 6-month follow-up"
```

  - We're claiming: 95%
  - Please provide: [Exact % verified from follow-up data] or [range] or [qualitative: "vast majority"]

  - Burnout score changes (e.g., "Average burnout score: 7.5/10 → 2.5/10")
  - Stress/anxiety metrics
  - Sleep improvements
  - Relationship quality improvements
  - Career progression (promotions? salary increases?)

**Export as**: Google Sheet or CSV with same format as Shalini's

**If data not available**:
- We can use softer claims instead:
  - "95% of clients maintain gains" → "Most clients maintain gains" or "Our clients report sustained benefits"
  - Numbers can come from future client feedback (we can update later)

### 3. Testimonial Outreach Help

- What metrics are actually available in your systems
- What can be verified vs. what needs softer language
- What testimonial candidates are strong

**Output**: Google Sheet with verified metrics + fallback language approved by end of Tuesday.

## TIMELINE SUMMARY

**MONDAY**:
- Review this checklist with you both at kickoff (9–10 AM)
- Confirm what you can deliver by Friday

**TUESDAY**:
- Extract metrics from CRM

- Final metrics export

**THURSDAY–FRIDAY**:

## QUESTIONS?

If you're unclear on any of these deliverables:
- **For photos/bios**: Ask for examples or templates
- **For metrics**: Ask what data sources are available
- **For testimonials**: Ask who the likely candidates are

Better to clarify now than scramble later!
