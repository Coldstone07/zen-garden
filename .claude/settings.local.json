Send calendar invites (Monday 9 AM kickoff + Tue-Fri daily standups)\n2. Identify 3-4 client candidates (Shalini & Jatin)\n3. Begin outreach to clients (Week 2)\n4. Collect coach origin stories (Shalini & Jatin)\n\nSTATUS: PHASE 3 Complete | PHASE 4 Pending (waiting for coach stories) | PHASE 5 Pending (Week 2)\n\n🧠 Generated with Claude Code\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",
