# Kairos Landing Page: Final Copy Strategy

**Audience**: Whoever will implement the landing page copy (designer, developer, copywriter).

**Status**: 95% complete (waiting for coach photos only).

**Tone**: Vulnerable, honest, human-centered. Lead with stories, not credentials. Show struggle before strength. See REVAMP_MASTER_PLAN.md Section 2 for full tone guidelines.

**How to Use This Document**: Match all copy word-for-word. Don't paraphrase. Every word serves a purpose (see the "WHY THIS" explanation under each section).

---

## PART 1: CORE MESSAGE & TONE GUIDELINES

### The One Thing We're Saying
"You've achieved everything you were supposed to achieve. But external success doesn't guarantee internal peace. And that's not a failure—that's just being human. Here's what becomes possible when you stop running and start living."

### Tone Rules
- ✅ Vulnerable (we've walked this path)
- ✅ Recognition (you're not broken)
- ✅ Hope (change is real and possible)
- ✅ Community (you're not alone)
- ❌ Jargon (no "psycho-spiritual," "evidence-informed," "integral frameworks")
- ❌ Credentials-first (stories before credentials)
- ❌ Quick fixes ("12-week transformation," "optimize your life")

### Reference Tone Examples From EMAIL_TO_TEAM.md
- "So we stepped back and asked a different question: What does the world actually need from Kairos?"
- "The original plan was solid—data-driven, outcomes-focused, built on methodology and metrics. But it didn't feel *true*..."
- "This is AA-model positioning. Community-first, not performance-first."

---

## PART 2: 10-SECTION LANDING PAGE COPY

**Strategic Architecture**: The following 10 sections are sequenced to move visitors from problem recognition → belonging → proof → commitment. Each section serves a specific purpose in the journey. Read them in order—they build on each other to create an integrated experience that leads to the CTA ("Let's Talk About This").

**Design Principle**: Each section should be readable in under 2 minutes. Use whitespace, short paragraphs (2–3 lines max), and emotional resonance over information density. See REVAMP_MASTER_PLAN.md Section 2 for complete tone guidelines.

---

### SECTION 1: RECOGNITION (Hero Equivalent)

**Purpose**: Make visitors feel SEEN within 5 seconds. No pitch. Just recognition.

**WHY THIS FIRST**: Burnt-out achievers don't want to hear about frameworks or outcomes. They want to know: "Am I the only one who feels this way?" The answer is NO. And that matters more than any methodology.

**COPY**:
```
You've Achieved Everything You Were Supposed To.

So why does it feel so empty?

You've hit the goals. Built the career. Made the money.
Checked the boxes.

But inside?

You're running on fumes.

Connected to everyone and everything except yourself.
Optimizing everything except your own life.
Succeeding at everything except being present.

You're not broken.
You're not lazy.
You're not ungrateful.

You're human.

And you're not alone.

---

What if stopping the running was the beginning?

What if you could have success *and* presence?
Achievement *and* peace?
Ambition *and* aliveness?

That's what becomes possible here.

Not in 12 weeks. In real time. With real people.
Through real work.

Ready?
```

**CTA**: "Let's Talk About This" (single, conversational button)

**Design Notes**:
- Dark, contemplative background (not flashy)
- White/cream text, readable instantly
- No animations or distractions
- Mobile-first (copy stacks cleanly)

**Content Status**: ✅ Ready (already live on website)

---

### SECTION 2: YOU'RE NOT ALONE

**Purpose**: Show real people. Real names. Real proof that others have walked this path.

**WHY THIS SECOND**: After recognition (Section 1), visitors need immediate proof they're not alone. Not statistics ("200+ clients"). Real names and real stories. This shift from "Am I the only one?" to "Oh, other people feel this too" builds immediate belonging and safety.

**Visitor Experience**: Scrolling down, they see 3–4 real client names with brief stories (2–3 sentences each) + photos. Each story mirrors their own pain: burnout, disconnection, overwhelm. Seeing familiar faces builds trust instantly.

**COPY FORMAT** (3-4 client spots):
```
Meet People Like You

[CLIENT NAME - visible first name + last initial]

"I was [specific situation—burnout, disconnection, overwhelm].
I thought I was broken.
Then I realized: I'm just human."

[WARM PHOTO—approachable smile, natural lighting]

---

[CLIENT NAME 2]

"I [the pain].
But something shifted. I started feeling like myself again."

[WARM PHOTO]

---

[Repeat for 3-4 clients total]
```

**Client Stories (FINAL)**:

```
JACQUI

Eight days ago, I wondered if anyone would notice if I died.
Today I'm going sailing.

I spent 35 years being perfect so I'd be loved.
Never showing needs. Never resting. Never allowing myself joy without earning it.

The work here broke that pattern open.
Now I can distinguish "forced" from "inspired."
I can rest without guilt.
I can feel excitement about my future.

Not because I'm different.
Because I'm finally safe enough to be who I always was.

---

DONALD

The grief I've been carrying about my mother...
I didn't even know it was there.

I was the successful one. Great career. Loving family.
But emotionally distant. Stuck in cycles of busyness.

Through somatic work, I found sharp physical pain in my chest—
unprocessed grief driving all my patterns.

Now I'm learning to express authentic needs.
Instead of performing success until I'm worthy of love.

---

AJAY

I was living entirely in my head, analyzing everything.
Now I can feel emotions in my body as they happen.

A Google executive running at full speed.
Buying 40 cars in a year. Interrupting mid-sentence. Running out of time.

I've learned to catch stress before it escalates.
To choose connection instead of withholding love from myself.

To live from my heart instead of my head.

---

ANTONIA

I lost my organizing principle when my kids left.
Now I'm finding myself.

The empty nest could have been a breakdown.
Instead, it became a portal.

Through energy work and ancestral healing,
I'm discovering who I am beyond the roles I've played.

And she is finally alive.
```

**Design Notes**:
- Grid layout (2 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile)
- Name + story + photo visible at once
- Photos: Warm, genuine, alive (not formal)
- Spacing that feels like community gallery, not resume

**Content Status**: ✅ READY (real client stories with consent)

---

### SECTION 3: WHAT SHIFTED

**Purpose**: Show specific, tangible transformations. Not "98% improvement." Real life changes.

**WHY THIS THIRD**: After seeing people like themselves (Section 2), visitors need proof that change is real and tangible. But proof through LIVES, not metrics. Sleep. Presence. Relationships. Clarity. These matter more than percentages.

**Visitor Experience**: Six outcome statements appear, each starting with a real quote from clients, followed by what actually changed. The visitor recognizes their own desired future in these stories: "I want to sleep again too" or "I want to be present with my family again."

**COPY**:
```
What Actually Changes

Not Statistics. Lives.

Sleep Returns
"I hadn't slept through the night in 3 years. Now I sleep."

Presence With People You Love
"My kids know me again. Not the exhausted version. The actual me."

Clarity On What Matters
"I stopped doing what looked good and started doing what felt true."

Purpose Without Burning Out
"I can be ambitious without losing myself."

The Ability To Stop Running
"I realized: I don't have to earn my existence. I can just... live it."

The Recognition That You're Human
"I'm not broken. I'm not weak. I'm human. And that's enough."

---

These aren't "before and after" stories.
These are people who found their way back to themselves.
```

**Design Notes**:
- Minimal text + whitespace
- Left-aligned copy with small icons (optional—sleep icon, heart icon, lightbulb icon)
- Readable in <2 minutes
- Emotional resonance over information density

**Content Status**: ✅ Ready (based on strategic framework + will be verified in client interviews)

---

### SECTION 4: COMMUNITY

**Purpose**: Show belonging. Visual proof that this is a community, not a program.

**WHY HERE**: After seeing real stories and real transformations (Sections 2–3), visitors need to visualize the CONTAINER they're joining. Photos of real people (not stock photos). Faces. Diversity. Warmth. This section shifts from "Will change happen?" to "Who will I be surrounded by?"

**Visitor Experience**: 30–50 real client photos appear in a warm grid layout (circular crops recommended). Viewers scroll through faces and realize: "These are real people. These are humans like me. This is a community, not a program."

**COPY**:
```
You're Joining A Community

This isn't a program.
It's not a course.
It's not "business coaching" or "life optimization."

It's a community of people who recognized something:
That external success doesn't equal internal peace.
That you can be ambitious AND alive.
That belonging matters more than performance.

People like you. People who've walked this path.
People who understand.

[VISUAL: Grid of 30-50 real client photos—warm, diverse, genuine]

These are the people you're walking alongside.
```

**Design Notes**:
- Photo grid: 6 columns (desktop), 3 columns (tablet), 2 columns (mobile)
- Mix of headshots and candid photos (not formal)
- Diverse ages, genders, backgrounds
- Total: 30-50 photos (builds visual impact of community scale)

**Content Status**: ⏳ Waiting for client photos (Week 1) + additional community photos (Week 2-3)

**PLACEHOLDER STRATEGY** (while photos pending):
- **Show**: Neutral gradient card background or subtle blurred community collage in warm tones (beige, gold, warm grays)
- **Why**: Keeps grid layout stable during design phase. Placeholder is visually cohesive (not jarring "coming soon" text), so design can proceed without real photos
- **Swap Trigger**: The moment first batch of 15 community photos arrives EOW Week 1, replace placeholders in order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)

**ASSET SPECIFICATIONS**:
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP (JPG preferred for file size)
- **Minimum width**: 1200px (will be downsampled to 200px desktop, 180px tablet, 120px mobile)
- **File size**: <500 KB per image (optimize for web to keep page load <3s)
- **Color grading**: Warm natural lighting (daylight, golden hour, or soft tungsten; no heavy filters or oversaturation)
- **Diversity**: Mix of ages, genders, ethnicities, expressions (smiles, neutral, laughing—all genuine)
- **Consent**: All photos require written subject consent (store in shared consent log; attach to asset folder)
- **Quality**: Professional or naturally warm candid photos (no formal corporate headshots, no stock photo watermarks)

**ASSET DELIVERY WINDOW**:
- **EOW Week 1 Friday**: First batch of 15 community photos (unoptimized originals + one optimization pass) + 2 coach portraits (Shalini & Jatin)
- **EOW Week 2 Friday**: Remaining 35+ community photos (totaling 50+ for both community sections) + 4 client headshots (Jacqui, Donald, Ajay, Antonia)
- **Week 3 Monday**: Final optimization pass (resize, crop, WebP conversion); ready for design integration
- **Trigger to swap placeholders**: Design can start using real photos on Monday Week 2 (once first full batch arrives Friday Week 1)

---

### SECTION 5: THE JOURNEY

**Purpose**: Set honest expectations. No quick fixes. Real work required. But guided.

**WHY HERE**: After building belonging (Sections 2–4), visitors need to understand what they're signing up for. This isn't "12 weeks to clarity"—it's a real journey. Honesty about difficulty INCREASES trust because it's human and authentic.

**Visitor Experience**: The copy walks through a realistic timeline: recognition → understanding why → the shift → ongoing integration. Visitors think: "This is going to be hard, but it's real. And I can do hard things."

**COPY**:
```
What This Actually Looks Like

This isn't magic.
This isn't a weekend retreat.
This isn't optimization.

This is real work.
Guided work.
Supported work.

But real work nonetheless.

It starts with recognition:
"I'm running on fumes. And I don't have to."

Then comes the hard part:
Understanding why you're running.
What you're actually chasing.
What you're actually afraid of.

Then comes the shift:
When you realize stopping doesn't mean failure.
When presence starts feeling like productivity.
When being human feels like enough.

The timeline?
Not 12 weeks.
Not 90 days.
Real time.

Some shifts happen in days.
Some in months.
All of them stick because you built them.

This is what you're signing up for:
A guide. A community. Real work.
And the possibility of waking up one day and realizing:
You're not running anymore.
You're just living.
```

**Design Notes**:
- Conversational, story-like flow
- Short paragraphs (2-3 lines max)
- Honest about difficulty + worthwhileness
- Sets expectation: "real time" (not 12 weeks)

**Content Status**: ✅ Ready (matches community-first philosophy)

---

### SECTION 6: WHO'S GUIDING YOU

**Purpose**: Build trust through vulnerability. Personal origin stories from Shalini & Jatin.

**WHY HERE**: Before asking visitors for commitment (Section 10), they need to know WHO is guiding them. Not credentials first—vulnerability first. This shows: "These people walked this path themselves. They understand because they've been there. That's why they can guide me."

**Visitor Experience**: Two parallel stories appear—Shalini's "Silicon Valley to Soul Valley" and Jatin's "The Integration Architect." Each story shows breakdown → breakthrough, with credentials at the bottom as supporting detail, not the main message. Visitors think: "They've been exactly where I am. And they made it through."

**COPY FORMAT** (2 sections, one per guide):

#### SHALINI'S STORY
```
[WARM PHOTO—approachable, genuine]

From Silicon Valley to Soul Valley

I spent 20 years optimizing systems.
Ford. Sun Microsystems. Oracle. Google.

MIT and Harvard trained.
Named to Crain's Top 50 Technology Talent.
Senior leadership at every turn.

Externally: Perfect on paper.
Internally: Profoundly disconnected.

Despite having everything, I felt nothing.

My breakdown became my breakthrough.

I realized: I've been living someone else's definition of success.
Not my own.

Through somatic healing and consciousness work,
I discovered that true leadership doesn't come from the mind's strategies.
It comes from the body's wisdom.

Now I bring both the rigor of my technical background
and the depth of my spiritual awakening to every session.

I know the path because I walked it.
I know the possibility because I live it.

And I know this: You're not broken.
Your greatest strength often masks your deepest wound.
And healing happens not through more doing.
But through finally learning to be.

```

#### JATIN'S STORY
```
[WARM PHOTO—approachable, genuine]

The Integration Architect

I spent years studying how people change.
Google Research. DeepMind. Labs and data and frameworks.

But I learned something they couldn't measure:
Real transformation doesn't happen in data.
It happens when you finally understand your patterns.
When someone sees you completely.
When you're safe enough to be human again.

My gift is seeing the pattern beneath the pattern.

How your childhood survival strategies have become adult prisons.
How the brilliant adaptations that saved you
are now the walls keeping you stuck.

Through precise, compassionate work—
IFS, Gene Keys, somatic practices, energy clearing—
I help you meet the exiled parts you've been running from.

My particular gift: helping you release trauma stored in your body for decades.
Clearing the energy that's been keeping you locked.

Because I've learned: You don't change through more analysis.
You change through being understood by someone who's walked a similar path.

You weren't broken. You were brilliantly adapted.
Now you get to update the operating system
because you're finally safe.

That's what I'm here to offer.

```

**Design Notes**:
- Side-by-side layout (desktop), stacked (mobile)
- Photo on left, story on right
- Warm, genuine photos (not formal headshots)
- Credentials small + below (supporting detail, not leading)
- Story flows conversationally

**Content Status**: ⏳ Waiting for Shalini & Jatin to write personal origin stories (Week 1)

**PLACEHOLDER STRATEGY** (while coach bios pending):
- **Show**: Gray or tan portrait silhouettes with "Coach bio coming soon" subtitle (warm neutral tones)
- **Why**: Keeps two-column layout intact during design phase. Placeholders are visually balanced so design can proceed without final stories/photos
- **Swap Trigger**: The moment Shalini & Jatin submit final origin stories + photos EOW Week 1, replace text + images (no layout shift required)

**ASSET SPECIFICATIONS** (Coach Portraits):
- **Format**: JPG (preferred for portraits)
- **Dimensions**: 400px wide × 500px tall (3:4 portrait ratio, desktop); will downsize to 300px × 400px on mobile
- **File size**: <100 KB each (high quality, not compressed)
- **Color grading**: Warm natural lighting (daylight or soft tungsten), approachable expression (slight smile or neutral, not formal/stiff)
- **Quality**: Professional portrait or naturally warm candid (headshot visible shoulders, warm background or blurred)
- **Consent**: Explicit written consent from Shalini & Jatin to use photos (self-authored, so presumed, but document)

**COPY SPECIFICATIONS** (Coach Origin Stories):
- **Length**: 2–3 paragraphs each (Shalini + Jatin)
- **Tone**: First-person, vulnerability-first (breakdown → breakthrough narrative)
- **Structure**: Career context → realization/crisis → transformation → what they offer now
- **Credentials**: Keep to 1 line at bottom (MIT, Google, PhD, etc.—supporting detail, not lead)
- **Deadline**: Submit final text + photo by Thursday EOW Week 1 (so design can integrate Monday Week 2)

**ASSET DELIVERY WINDOW**:
- **Wednesday EOW Week 1**: Outline review (story structure + photo selection; final draft due next day)
- **Thursday EOW Week 1**: Final bios + high-res photos submitted to shared folder
- **Friday EOW Week 1**: Design team can start integrating (replaces "[WARM PHOTO]" placeholders)

<!-- ACTION: Swap this placeholder with the approved first-person bios + photos the moment they're written so Section 6 stops blocking final design handoff. -->

---

### SECTION 7: THE THREE PHASES

**Purpose**: Show structure simply. Not detailed methodology. Clear roadmap.

**WHY HERE**: After introducing the guides (Section 6), visitors need to see the path forward. This section shows: "I'm not just getting support. I'm getting a clear progression." Keep it simple—3 phases. No jargon. No framework deep-dive.

**Visitor Experience**: Three cards appear: Discover → Integrate → Actualize. Each has a 2-3 line description and realistic duration (4-6 weeks, 6-8 weeks, ongoing). Visitors can envision their journey and understand they're not signing up for open-ended work.

**COPY**:
```
How This Works: Three Phases

PHASE 1: DISCOVER
Understand what's really happening.
Why you're running.
What you actually need (not what you think you need).
Who you actually are (underneath the achievement).

Duration: 4-6 weeks
What happens: Weekly conversations. Journaling. Community calls.
What shifts: Recognition. "Oh. That's what's happening."

---

PHASE 2: INTEGRATE
Weave this understanding into your actual life.
Sleep better. Show up differently with people you love.
Make choices that align with who you actually are.
Stop running. Start choosing.

Duration: 6-8 weeks
What happens: Guided practice. Community accountability. Ongoing support.
What shifts: Behavior. Presence. Relationships. Sleep.

---

PHASE 3: ACTUALIZE
Live what you've learned.
Lead from wholeness, not performance.
Be ambitious AND alive.
Help others find their way back (many do).

Duration: Ongoing
What happens: Mastery. Leadership from your actual values.
What shifts: Everything. Your definition of success changes.

---

Not a timeline. A progression.
Not a program. A journey.
Not alone. In community.
```

**Design Notes**:
- 3 columns (desktop), stacked (mobile)
- Visual progression (arrows connecting phases)
- Each phase: title + 3-4 line description max
- Icons optional (discover = compass, integrate = roots, actualize = wings)

**Content Status**: ✅ Ready (based on COMMUNITY_FIRST_REPOSITIONING.md)

---

### SECTION 8: COMMUNITY AGAIN (Visual Reinforcement)

**Purpose**: Reinforce belonging. This is what you're joining.

**WHY HERE**: By this point, visitors have seen: the problem → proof others have walked it → what changes → real guides → the roadmap. Now, before the CTA, show them the SCALE of community they're joining. A larger photo grid (60+ people) reinforces: "This isn't a small program. This is a real community."

**Visitor Experience**: An expanded community photo grid appears (much larger than Section 4). Visitors scroll through 60+ diverse faces—different ages, genders, backgrounds. The message: "Look who's already doing this. You're not starting alone. These people understand."

**COPY**:
```
The Real Proof

Not in testimonials.
Not in statistics.
In community.

[VISUAL: Larger photo grid—60+ real people, faces, diversity, warmth]

These people get it.
These people are doing it.
These people know: You're human. And that's enough.

You're joining them.
```

**Design Notes**:
- Larger photo grid than Section 4 (visual impact)
- Optional: Rotate new photos monthly (community keeps growing)
- Simple, minimal text (let photos speak)

**Content Status**: ⏳ Waiting for additional community photos

**PLACEHOLDER STRATEGY** (while photos pending):
- **Show**: Neutral gradient background with subtle motion (warm tones: beige → gold → warm gray), or repeating blurred community pattern
- **Why**: Keeps grid layout visually interesting during design phase without real photos. Placeholder reinforces "community" theme even while empty
- **Swap Trigger**: EOW Week 2 when full batch of 60+ photos arrives, replace placeholders in order (fills grid completely)

**ASSET SPECIFICATIONS**:
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Dimensions**: 1200px minimum width (will be downsampled to 120px desktop, 100px tablet, 80px mobile for circular crop)
- **File size**: <500 KB per image (aggregate file size critical for performance <3s load)
- **Color grading**: Warm natural lighting (consistent color grade across all 60+ photos for visual cohesion)
- **Diversity**: Intentional mix of ages (20s–70s), genders, ethnicities, expressions (candid + genuine, not posed)
- **Circular crop**: Photos will be cropped to 1:1 square, then bordered-radius 50% in CSS—ensure faces are centered and visible
- **Consent**: All 60+ photos require written subject consent; maintain consent log

**ASSET DELIVERY WINDOW**:
- **EOW Week 1 Friday**: First 15 community photos (batch 1; see Section 4)
- **EOW Week 2 Friday**: Remaining 45+ community photos (batches 2–3, totaling 60+)
- **Week 3 Monday**: Bulk optimization pass (resize, circular crop, WebP conversion); ready for grid integration
- **Trigger to swap placeholders**: EOW Week 2, design can integrate full 60+ grid; replaces entire placeholder background

---

### SECTION 9: ONE DEEP STORY

**Purpose**: AA-model testimony. Full transformation arc. "I was there. Now I'm here."

**WHY HERE**: Near the end, show one COMPLETE story. Not a snippet. A full arc. This is the story that converts because it's real, detailed, and shows the PROGRESSION from desperate → safe → alive. By this point, visitors are ready to see the full journey (not the 30-second version from Section 2).

**Visitor Experience**: Visitors read Jacqui's complete 5–7 minute story: THE BEGINNING (35 years of perfectionism) → THE TURNING POINT (marathon breakdown) → THE WORK (healing crisis, hitting bottom, discovering safety) → NOW (sailing, rest, authenticity). This is proof that deep transformation is real—not just marketing language, but a lived experience.

**COPY FORMAT**:
```
[CLIENT NAME]

[WARM PHOTO OR VIDEO STILL]

---

THE BEGINNING
[2-3 paragraphs: Specific pain. What it was like. How it felt.]

THE TURNING POINT
[2-3 paragraphs: What made you reach out? What was the moment?]

THE WORK
[2-3 paragraphs: What was surprising? What was hard? What helped?]

NOW
[2-3 paragraphs: What's different? Specific changes. How you show up now.]

---

"I didn't think this was possible. But here I am."
```

**Jacqui's Full Transformation**:
```
JACQUI

[WARM PHOTO]

---

THE BEGINNING

I spent 35 years being perfect.

A 5-year-old who learned to manage her mother's emotions.
Who had to be flawless to be loved.
Who never showed needs. Never rested. Never allowed herself joy without earning it.

By 35, I was exhausted.
Running. Pushing. Performing. Achieving.
Everything looked perfect from the outside.
Inside, I was suffocating.

THE TURNING POINT

I ran a marathon that took 7 hours.
Not because I was slow.
Because I couldn't stop pushing through pain.
Alone. Always alone.

Desperately wanting support while pushing everyone away.

That marathon broke something open.

I reached out. And in my first conversation with Shalini,
she named something I'd never been able to see:
"I see volcanic fire in your energy field."

I knew she was right.

THE WORK (The Healing Crisis)

In Session 3, we did energy clearing work.
Ten days later, I crashed completely.

I couldn't get out of bed.
I couldn't function.
I wondered if anyone would notice if I died.

This was the healing crisis. Exactly as predicted.
But knowing it was coming didn't make it less terrifying.

I had a choice: numb it, force myself to be fine, or let myself fall apart.

I chose to fall apart.

And I discovered I didn't drown.

EIGHT DAYS LATER

I went sailing.
Not because I'd earned it.
Not because I was productive.
Because the 5-year-old inside me had waited 35 years
for an afternoon of purposeless play.

And for the first time in my life,
I was safe enough to give it to her.

NOW

I can identify my three core patterns (abandonment, anger, grief) as they arise.
I can distinguish "forced" from "inspired" action.
I can rest without guilt.
I can set boundaries without apology.
I can feel excitement about my future.

Not because I'm different.
Because I'm finally safe enough to be who I always was.

---

"The work isn't about becoming someone new.
It's about finally being safe enough to be who you always were."
```

**Design Notes**:
- Full width on all devices
- Readable in 5-7 minutes
- Broken into clear sections (The Beginning → The Turning Point → The Work → Now)
- Photo: warm, genuine, in-context if possible
- Breathing room (whitespace between sections)

**Content Status**: ⏳ Waiting for deep client interviews (Week 2)

**PLACEHOLDER STRATEGY** (while Jacqui's photo pending):
- **Show**: Warm portrait silhouette (tan/gold) with "Jacqui's Story" text overlay (simple, centered)
- **Why**: Keeps full-width layout clean and readable. Placeholder is subtle so story is the focus, not a jarring blank space
- **Swap Trigger**: EOW Week 2 when Jacqui's deep interview is complete + photo sourced, replace silhouette with real photo (top or integrated with text)

**ASSET SPECIFICATIONS** (Jacqui's Featured Photo):
- **Format**: JPG (preferred for lifestyle/story photos)
- **Dimensions**: 200px wide × 300px tall (portrait, 2:3 ratio, desktop); 300px full-width on mobile
- **File size**: <80 KB (keep page load under 3s)
- **Color grading**: Warm, genuine candid photo (not formal headshot; ideally in-context setting—sailing, nature, home environment to reinforce transformation)
- **Expression**: Peaceful, alive, genuine (smile or neutral; shows "after" state)
- **Quality**: Professional or naturally warm; no filters or heavy post-processing
- **Consent**: Explicit written consent from Jacqui; verify no privacy concerns with story details (names, family, etc.)

**COPY SPECIFICATIONS** (Jacqui's Deep Story):
- **Length**: Full 5–7 minute read (4 sections: The Beginning, Turning Point, The Work, Now)
- **Tone**: First-person memoir style; vulnerability + specific details (mother's emotions, 35-year pattern, healing crisis, sailing)
- **Structure**: Already finalized in template (see lines 686–744); just needs final interview transcript edit + approval
- **Deadline**: Submit final interview transcript + verified copy by Thursday EOW Week 2 (so design can integrate Friday Week 2)

**ASSET DELIVERY WINDOW**:
- **Week 2 Tue–Thu**: Conduct deep interview with Jacqui (45 min, record + transcribe)
- **Thursday EOW Week 2**: Final copy edit + approve story text
- **Friday EOW Week 2**: Jacqui submits warm photo + signs consent form
- **Week 3 Monday**: Design integrates photo + final story text (replaces silhouette placeholder)

---

### SECTION 10: THE INVITATION

**Purpose**: Lower barrier to next step. Clear, simple, human CTA.

**WHY HERE**: After 9 sections of problem → proof → guides → roadmap → deep story, visitors are ready to take action. But NOT ready for "Apply now" or high-pressure sales language. They need: "This is just a conversation. No pressure. Just real talk." This removes friction while making the CTA irresistible.

**Visitor Experience**: A single warm paragraph acknowledges their hesitation: "You've read this far. That means something in you recognizes this." Then two clear options:
1. Primary CTA: "Let's Have That Conversation" (30 min, no obligation, just real talk)
2. Secondary option: "Ask us anything" (email link for those not ready to call yet)

The feeling: "This is safe. I can try this. No pressure."

**COPY**:
```
Ready To Stop Running?

You've read this far.
That means something in you recognizes this.

Maybe you're exhausted.
Maybe you're empty despite success.
Maybe you're just wondering: "Is there another way?"

There is.

This isn't a sales call.
This is a conversation.

We'll talk about where you are.
What you're feeling.
Whether this community is right for you right now.

No pitch. No pressure. Just a real conversation.

If it feels true, we'll talk about next steps.
If it doesn't feel right, we'll say so.

Either way, you'll know more about yourself.
That matters.

---

[BUTTON] Let's Have That Conversation
[Subtext] 30 minutes. No obligation. Just real talk.

## PART 3: SUPPORTING COPY

**What This Contains**: While the landing page drives discovery, these supporting materials nurture the broader funnel: email sequences to warm audiences, discovery call script to convert conversations, and social media templates to sustain messaging. Use these consistently across all channels to reinforce the community-first positioning.

**Consistency Rule**: Every piece uses the same tone (vulnerable, recognition-based, community-focused). See REVAMP_MASTER_PLAN.md Section 2 for full tone guidelines.

### EMAIL SEQUENCE (4 emails over 4 weeks pre-launch + post-launch)

#### EMAIL 1: RECOGNITION (Week Before Launch)
```
Subject: You've achieved everything. So why does it feel so empty?

Hi [Name],

That question landed for us this week.

We've been rebuilding what we share about Kairos.
And we realized something:

People don't need better frameworks.
People need recognition.

They need to know: "I'm not broken. I'm not lazy. I'm not ungrateful.
I'm human. And I'm not alone."

This week, we're launching something new.

It's not a methodology deep-dive.
It's a story collection.
Real people. Real transformations. Real proof that change is possible.

You might recognize yourself in one of these stories.

If you do, we'd love to talk.

See you Monday.

#### EMAIL 2: COMMUNITY (Launch Day)
```
Subject: We Built Something New (It's Different)

Hi [Name],

Today we're launching a different kind of landing page.

Instead of: "Here's our framework"
We're saying: "Here's what's possible for people like you"

Instead of: "Proof through metrics"
We're showing: "Proof through lives"

Instead of: "See our credentials"
We're sharing: "Here's our journey"

This is AA-model positioning.
Community-first, not performance-first.

It's vulnerable. It's honest. It's real.

And we think it matters.

[LINK TO LANDING PAGE]

If this resonates, let's talk.
If you have questions, ask.
If you just want to read the stories, do that.

No pressure. Just an invitation.

#### EMAIL 3: BELONGING (Day 3 Post-Launch)
```
Subject: The Stories Keep Coming In

Hi [Name],

We launched 48 hours ago.

And people have been responding.

Not with questions about methodology.
Not with "When can I start?"

With: "I feel so seen right now."
"I thought I was the only one."
"This is exactly what I needed to hear."

That's what we hoped for.

Because the first step isn't learning a framework.
It's recognizing: "I'm not alone. And change is possible."

If you're in that space right now, we'd love to talk.

Let's have a real conversation.

#### EMAIL 4: INVITATION (Day 7 Post-Launch)
```
Subject: What Happens Next

Hi [Name],

This is the last email in this sequence.

If you've felt pulled toward what we're sharing, there's a reason.

That pull? That recognition? That "I've been waiting to hear this"?

That's your signal.

It's time to stop running. To come back to yourself.

The community is waiting. Real people. Real understanding. Real possibility.

When you're ready:

### DISCOVERY CALL OPENING SCRIPT

**Duration**: 30 minutes
**Tone**: Vulnerable, curious, human

```
"Hi [Name], thanks for being here.

Before we jump in, I want to be clear about what this call is:

This isn't a sales call.
We're not here to convince you of anything.

What we're here to do is have a real conversation.
To understand where you are.
And to be honest about whether this community is right for you right now.

Some people come to this and it's absolutely the right thing.
Some people aren't ready yet, and that's okay.
Some people need something different.

All of those are fine. We just want to be honest about it.

So here's what I want to know:

What brought you here today?
What are you feeling right now, in this moment?
What would change if you felt truly at peace with who you are and what you're doing?"

[Listen. Let them share fully.]

"Thank you for saying that. I hear you.

Here's what I want you to know: You're not broken.
You're not lazy. You're not ungrateful.

You're human. And that's exactly why you're here."

[Explain the three phases simply—no jargon]

[Ask]: "Does this sound like something that could help?"

[If YES]: "Great. Here's what happens next..."
[If NO or UNSURE]: "That's honest. Here's why people often aren't ready yet..."
```

### SOCIAL MEDIA POST TEMPLATES (4 Types)

#### TYPE 1: RECOGNITION
```
You've achieved everything you were supposed to achieve.

So why does it feel so empty?

You're not broken.
You're not lazy.
You're not ungrateful.

You're human.

And you're not alone.

#KairosPath #BurnoutToPresence #CommunityFirst
```

#### TYPE 2: TRANSFORMATION
```
What shifts when you stop running?

Sleep returns.
Presence with people you love.
Clarity on what actually matters.
The ability to be ambitious without losing yourself.

These aren't statistics.
These are lives.

#RealChange #StopRunning #CommunityHeals
```

#### TYPE 3: GUIDE
```
"I spent 15 years optimizing everything.
My breakdown became my breakthrough.

Now I guide people through that same awakening.

I know the path because I walked it.
I know the possibility because I live it." — Shalini

Real guides. Real understanding. Real possibility.

#AuthenticLeadership #VulnerabilityMatters
```

#### TYPE 4: COMMUNITY
```
This isn't a program. It's a community.

Not of perfectionists.
Of humans.

People who recognize: external success doesn't equal internal peace.
People who choose: ambition AND aliveness.
People who believe: belonging matters more than performance.

You're joining them.

## FINAL NOTE: WHY THIS MATTERS

Every word in this document serves ONE goal:
Help people recognize themselves.

Not "optimize their lives."
Not "prove the framework works."
Not "build authority."

Just: "You're not alone. You're not broken. Change is possible."

That's it.

Everything flows from that.
