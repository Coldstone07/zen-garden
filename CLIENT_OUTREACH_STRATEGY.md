# Client Outreach Strategy: Deep Story Collection

**Phase**: Week 1 (identification) + Week 2 (interviews)

**Goal**: Identify and recruit 3-4 clients willing to share deep transformation stories

---

## WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

### Ideal Client Profile

**Burning Issue** (they came to Kairos with):
- Burnout despite external success
- Feeling empty despite achievement
- Disconnected from relationships / presence
- Lost sense of purpose or meaning
- Overwhelm from "doing it all"

**Transformation Evidence** (they've experienced):
- Better sleep or presence with family
- Recovered relationships or deeper connection
- Clarity on what actually matters
- Ability to stop "running" and "start living"
- Sense of belonging in the community
- Recognition of their humanity (not broken)

**Willingness to Share**:
- Open to being vulnerable publicly
- Can articulate their journey in simple language
- Represent the "burnt-out achiever" archetype
- Have enough emotional distance from the journey (not still in crisis)

### Who to Look For

**Best Candidates**:
- Long-term clients (6+ months with Kairos)
- Clients who've mentioned feeling "seen" or "understood"
- Clients who recommend Kairos to others
- Clients in leadership/achievement-oriented fields (tech, finance, medicine, consulting)
- Clients with observable life changes (sleep, relationships, work choices)

**Avoid**:
- Very recent clients (still processing initial shifts)
- Clients still in active crisis
- Clients who are hesitant about privacy
- Clients currently struggling with something sensitive
- Clients who might use this for personal branding

---

## IDENTIFICATION PROCESS (Week 1)

### Step 1: Review Client List
**Owner**: Shalini & Jatin (with you if helpful)
**Time**: 30 minutes
**Task**: Look through your active/recent client list and identify:
- Who shows clear transformation pattern
- Who feels comfortable with vulnerability
- Who you genuinely think would help others by sharing

### Step 2: Create Shortlist
**Owner**: Shalini & Jatin
**Time**: 15 minutes
**Output**: List of 4-6 candidates with:
- Client name (first name + last initial for privacy)
- Why they're a good fit
- One specific transformation (sleep, relationships, clarity, etc.)
- Confidence level they'll say yes (High/Medium/Low)

**Example**:
```
1. Sarah M. (High)
   - Transformation: Better sleep, presence with kids
   - Why: She mentions "I feel human again" regularly
   - Background: Tech executive, 8 months with us

2. James K. (Medium)
   - Transformation: Left high-stress job, found purpose
   - Why: Vulnerable in sessions, clear growth
   - Background: Finance, 6 months, slightly private

3. Maya P. (High)
   - Transformation: Reconnected with spouse, joy returned
   - Why: She says Kairos "saved her marriage"
   - Background: Consultant, 10 months, very open
```

### Step 3: Get Internal Approval
**Owner**: You (coordinates with Shalini & Jatin)
**Time**: 10 minutes
**Task**: Review shortlist together and confirm:
- Does everyone feel good about approaching these people?
- Any privacy concerns?
- Are they the right cultural fit for the landing page?

## OUTREACH PROCESS (Week 1-2)

### Email Template: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: Share Your Story + Help Us Launch Something New

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

We're rebuilding our landing page, and we want to tell real stories—not just theory.

We're looking for 3-4 people who've experienced a real shift through their work with Kairos.
People who came in overwhelmed, burnt out, or lost—and found their way back to themselves.

We think your story matters. Not because it's perfect. Because it's real.

If you're open to it, we'd love to:
1. Do a 45-minute recorded conversation (can be private, can remain anonymous)
2. Share your before-and-after in your own words
3. Help other people see: "This is possible. I'm not alone."

We're offering [OPTIONAL: small compensation / thank you gift] as a token of appreciation.

No pressure. If this doesn't feel right, we totally understand.

If you're interested, let's set up a call this week.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

[Your name]
Kairos
```

### Phone/Video Call: Initial Conversation

**Goal**: Get their buy-in to participate

**Talking Points**:
1. "We're shifting how we talk about Kairos—less methodology, more humanity"
2. "Your story shows that this actually works—you're the proof"
3. "We'd interview you for 45 min, then write up your story (you approve final version)"
4. "This could help someone just like you recognize themselves"
5. "Complete privacy/anonymity if you want it"

**Response Handling**:
- **"Yes"** → Schedule interview for Week 2
- **"Maybe"** → Give them 48 hours to decide, follow up once
- **"No"** → "No worries! If your thoughts change, let us know"

### Week 2: Deep Dive Interview

**Timeline**: Tuesday-Thursday of Week 2

**Interview Format**:
- 45 minutes (recorded, private)
- 3 main questions
- Conversational, not scripted
- Optional: Can remain anonymous or use first name only

**Three Core Questions**:

1. **"Tell me about where you were before Kairos—what brought you to us?"**
   - Listen for: specific pain, burnout, disconnection, feeling broken
   - Goal: Establish the "before" state

2. **"What's shifted for you since starting this work?"**
   - Listen for: sleep, relationships, presence, clarity, purpose, belonging
   - Goal: Show the transformation

3. **"What would you tell someone who's going through what you went through?"**
   - Listen for: hope, possibility, humanity, "you're not alone"
   - Goal: The message that converts others

**Recording Notes**:
- Use video (Zoom/Google Meet) so you can capture tone and emotion
- Get permission to record (they'll sign simple release)
- Record to cloud (Google Drive, Dropbox)
- Transcribe + edit (remove filler words, "umms", clarify language)
- Send back to client for approval before using

## WHAT COMES NEXT (Week 2-3)

### After Interview
1. Transcribe + edit (make natural language readable)
2. Send back to client: "Here's how we transcribed your story—does this feel right?"
3. Get approval (they can request edits)
4. Format for landing page (400-600 words typically)

### Story Format for Website
```
[CLIENT NAME/FIRST NAME ONLY]

"Here's where I was: [specific burnout + pain]

I tried [what didn't work]. Then I found Kairos.

The shift came when [key breakthrough moment]

Now: [new reality—sleep, presence, clarity, purpose]

If you're where I was, I want you to know: you're not broken. You're human."

[Optional: Photo of client, warm smile, approachable]

## COMMON CONCERNS + RESPONSES

**"What if they say no?"**
- Totally fine. We only need 3-4. If someone says no, move to next candidate.

**"What about privacy?"**
- Option to use first name only, or full anonymity (use composite story)
- Never share without written permission
- Their story is their intellectual property

**"What if their story isn't 'good enough'?"**
- Real is better than perfect. Messy is relatable. Honest is powerful.
- If story doesn't fit the landing page, we can use it for testimonials, social media, other places

**"How much time do they need to commit?"**
- Initial call: 45 minutes (recorded)
- Feedback round: 15 minutes (review transcript, approve)
- Total: ~1 hour. Done.

**"Should we pay them?"**
- Optional. Good options: $200-500, gift card to favorite restaurant, donation in their name to charity
